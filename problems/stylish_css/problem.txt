Style your HTML from previous example with some Stylus middleware. The path to main.styl file is provided in process.argv[3] or you can create your own file/folder from these:

  p
    color red

The index.html file:

  <html>
    <head>
      <title>expressworks</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>I am red!</p>
    </body>
  </html>


-----------------------------

HINTS

To plug-in stylus someone can use this middleware:

  app.use(require('stylus').middleware(__dirname + '/public'));

Remember that you need also to serve static files.

NOTE

For your own projects, Stylus requires to be installed like any other dependency: npm install stylus.
