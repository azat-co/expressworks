Create an Express.js app with a home page (/home) rendered by jade template engine, that shows current date (toDateString).

-----------------------------

HINTS

Jade template file index.jade is already provided:

  h1 Hello World
  p Today is #{date}.

This is how to specify path in a typical Express.js app considering that the folder is 'templates':

  app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'templates'))

However, to use our index.jade, the path to index.jade will be provided in the process.argv[3] value. You are welcome to use your own jade file!

To tell Express.js app what template engine to use, apply this line to Express.js configuration:

  app.set('view engine', 'jade')

Instead of Hello World's res.end, the res.render function accepts filename and data:

  res.render('index', {date: new Date().toDateString()})

We use toDateString() to simply return the date in a human readable format sans time.


--------------------------------

NOTE

When creating your projects from scratch, install jade dependency with NPM.

Again, the port to use is passed {appname} to the application as process.argv[2].
