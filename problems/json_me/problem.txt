Write a server that reads a file (file name is passed in process.argv[3]), parses it to JSON and outputs the content to the user with res.json(object).


-----------------------------

HINTS

For reading, there's an fs module, e.g.,

  fs.fileRead(filename, callback)

While the parsing can be done with JSON.parse:

  object = JSON.parse(string)

Do not forget: maybe you won't get a valid JSON!
