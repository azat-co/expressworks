Apply static middleware to serve index.html file without any routes. The index.html file is provided and usable via process.argv[3] value of the path to it. However, you can use your own file with this content:

  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>I am red!</p>
    </body>
  </html>

HINTS

This you someone can call static middleware:

  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

For this exercise ExpressWorks will pass you the path:

  app.use(express.static(process.argv[3]||path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
