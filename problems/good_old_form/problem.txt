Write a route ('/form') that processes HTML form input (<form><input name="str"/></form>) and prints backwards the str value.

HINTS

To handle POST request use the post() method which work just like get():

app.post('/path', function(req, res){...});

Express.js use middleware to provide extra functionality to your web server.
Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.
Middlewares provide a large variety of functionalities such as logging, serving static files and error handling.

Middleware is added by calling use() on the application and passing the middleware as a parameter:

  var app = express();
  app.use(express.urlencoded())
  app.get(...);

Express.js has urlencoded() middleware (from Connect library):

  app.use(express.urlencoded())

Here is how we can flip the characters:

  req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')

-----------------------------

Avoid using soon to be depricated bodyParser() middleware.
