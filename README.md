# Steps


## Hello World

Create an Express.js app that runs on localhost:3000, and outputs "Hello World!" when somebody goes to root '/home'.

`process.argv[2]` will be provided by expressworks to you, this is the port number.

## Jade

Create an Express.js app with a home page (/home) rendered by jade template engine, that shows current date (toDateString).


## Good Old Form

Write a route ('/form') that processes HTML form input (<form><imput name="str"/></form>) and prints backwards the str value.

## Static

Apply static middleware to server index.html file without any routes. The index.html file is provided and usable via `process.argv[3]` value of the path to it. However, you can use you're own file with this content:

```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>I am red!</p>
    </body>
  </html>
```

## Stylish CSS

Style your HTML from previous example with some Stylus middleware. The path to main.styl file is provided in `process.argv[3]` or you can create your own file/folder from these:

```css
  p
    color red
```

The index.html file:

```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>expressworks</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>I am red!</p>
    </body>
  </html>
```

## Param Pam Pam 

Create an Express.js server that processes PUT `/message/:id` requests, e.g., PUT `/message/526aa677a8ceb64569c9d4fb`.

As the response of this request return id SHA1 hashed with a date:

```javascript
  require('crypto')
    .createHash('sha1')
    .update(new Date().toDateString().toString() + id)
    .digest('hex')
```

## What's in Query

Write a route that extracts data from query string in the GET `/search` URL route, e.g., `?results=recent&include_tabs=true`, and then transforms outputs it back to the user in JSON format.

## JSON Me

Write a server that reads a file (file name is passed in `process.argv[3]`), parses it to JSON and outputs the content to the user with `res.json(object)`.
