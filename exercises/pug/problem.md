Create an Express.js app with a home page rendered by the Pug template engine.

The home page should respond to `/home`.

The view should show the current date using 'new Date.toDateString()'.

We use 'toDateString()' to simply return the date in a human-readable format
without the time.

-----------------------------

## HINTS

The Pug template file `index.pug` must look like this:

```pug
h1 Hello World
p Today is #{date}.
```

You can use our `index.pug` (recommended). The path to `index.pug` will be provided in
`process.argv[3]`. Of course, you are welcome to use your own Pug file. Just make sure it's exactly the same as ours.

This is how you can specify the path to the template files in the folder `templates`:

```js
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'templates'))
```

The `__dirname` is the absolute path of this file and path.join is used to produce cross-platform path (Win vs. Linux/Mac).

To tell Express.js app what template engine to use, apply this line to the
Express.js configuration:

```js
app.set('view engine', 'pug')
```

Instead of Hello World's `res.end()`, the `res.render()` function accepts
a template name and data (called locals):

```js
res.render('index', {date: new Date().toDateString()})
```

We use `toDateString()` to simply return the date in a human-readable format
without the time.

--------------------------------

## NOTE

When creating your projects from scratch, install the `pug` dependency with npm.
If you run `$ npm install` on this package (expressworks), you should have pug installed.

Again, the port to use is passed by {appname} to the application as `process.argv[2]`.

If you receive `Error: Cannot find module 'pug'`, it is because Express is looking for Pug relative to its path. You can fix this by running `npm install pug`.
