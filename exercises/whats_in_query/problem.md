Oftentimes, we need to process the data from the URL query string (urlencoded).

Write a route that extracts data from the query string in the GET `/search` URL
route, e.g. `?results=recent&include_tabs=true` and then outputs it back to
the user in JSON format.

Use app.get('/search', function(){...}) for the route.

In Express.js, to extract query string parameters, we can use (inside the request handler):

```js
req.query.NAME
```

Your solution must listen on the port number supplied by `process.argv[2]`.

## HINTS

No need to install query middleware. It's part of the Express.js framework.

To output JSON we can use:

```js
res.send(object)
```
