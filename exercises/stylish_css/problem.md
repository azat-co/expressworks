HTML without styles is boring so this exercise will teach you how to use Stylus with Express on the fly.

Style the HTML from the "STATIC" exercise using Stylus middleware.
Stylus <https://github.com/stylus/stylus> generates .css files on-the-fly from
`.styl` files.

Your solution should listen on the port supplied by `process.argv[2]` for
`GET` requests, one of which will be for `main.css`, which should be
automatically generated by your Stylus middleware. `index.html` and `main.styl`
can be found in `process.argv[3]` (they are in the same directory).

You could also create your own folder and use these, if you like:

The `main.styl` file:

```stylus
p
  color red
```

The `index.html` file:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>expressworks</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am red!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

-----------------------------

## HINTS

You'll want to plug in some stylus middleware using `app.use` again.
It'll look something like this:

```js
app.use(require('stylus').middleware('/path/to/*.styl' ))
```

In addition to producing in the "STATIC" exercise, you'll need to serve static files.
Remember that middleware is executed in the order `app.use` is called!

## NOTE

For your own projects, Stylus needs to be installed like any other
dependency:

```sh
$ npm install stylus
```
